# eve

Eve is a governance minimized CosmWasm blockchain intended to push forward the state of the art in Cosmos.

Contract uploads are not permissioned in any way, and governance thresholds have been adjusted to ensure that contract authors are not disturbed in their work.   This chain emphasizes decentralization, interchain capability and governance minimization.

Eve won't compete with your contracts, and views herself as a beautiful, fertile platform for authors to bring their visions to life.

## Software at launch

* cosmos-sdk v0.50.x
* cometbft v0.38.x
* CosmWasm v0.51.x
* WasmVM v2.0.x
* ibc-go v8.3.x
* Token Factory
* IBC Hooks

This also means that Eve, as a loving mother and repeatable template, is committed to ensuring that the modules and middlewares above are kept up to date rigorously, with "up to date" being defined as supporting the latest release of cosmos-sdk, **regardless of the decisions of other teams**.  Eve is very confident in the current cosmos-sdk and ibc-go maintenance teams and smiles warmly at them.

## Planned software

If it is possible, we will get these in at launch:

* gpu support from cyber-sdk
* interchain security provider
* mesh security provider

### Upstreaming

In all cases, when stuff changes here and we find it nice, we'll feed it back to parent repositories.

### Downstream

Likely stuff built and tested here feeds into White Whale, Composable, Cyber, SpacePussy, **unnamed chain**, Quicksilver, Osmosis, Stargaze, Archway and Neutron.

## Team

Contributors == team.

Quicksilver and affiliated teams plan to use eve to put the newest SDK, IBC and WASMD into produciton quickly.  If you have ideas for eve, please feel free to fork and make a PR.

If you want to write an upgrade for Eve, it can be shipped from any repository, and you can just reference the url and commit hash.

## Promises

Eve will remain as simple as possible, while using the latest cosmos ecosystem libraries.  Eve won't use her community pool to compete with your contracts, becasue eve does not have a community pool.

## No Promises

Eve doesn't make promises and may not be exactly as described because she's an exploration of ideas first and foremost.  This includes the airdrop.

## Economic Information

Eve thinks that beauty comes from simplicity, and economic design follows this.

## Imperative

From eve will flow new designs and techniques that increase development velocity and ease of use across Cosmos.
